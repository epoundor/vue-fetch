# **API Caller Wrapper for Vue.js**

This package allows you to easily make calls to API using Vue.js. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for making API calls and follows the best practices for integrating with the Vue.js lifecycle.

## **Installation**

To install the package, simply run the following command:

```bash
npm i @epoundor/vue-fetch
```

## **Usage**

To use the package, first import it into your Vue component:

```jsx
import {VFetcher} from "@epoundor/vue-fetch";
```

Next , you can use the package's methods to make API calls and handle the responses:

```js
const { data, error, execute, isAborted, isFinished, isLoading, registerSuccessCallback, registerErrorCallback } = new VFetcher("https://example.com/").fetc();
```

Additionally, the package provides a comprehensive state management system, allowing you to keep track of the progress of your API calls.

## **Example**


```js
import axios from "axios"
import {VFetcher} from '@epoundor/vue-fetch'

const axiosInstance = axios.create({
      withCredentials: true,
      baseURL: baseUrl,
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Accept: "application/json",
      },
    })

const api = new VFecther("https://example.com/",axiosInstance).fetch
const {execute} = api("/some-endpoint", { method: "GET" });

execute();

```

## **Recommended Usage**

Use hooks

```js
// api/posts
export function useFetchPosts() {
  return api("/some-endpoint", { method: "GET" });
}
```

```js
import { useFetchPosts } from "./api/posts";
import { onMounted } from "vue";
const {
  execute: fetchPosts,
  registerErrorCallback: onError,
  registerSuccessCallback: onSuccess,
} = useFecthPosts();

onError((error) => {
  console.error("Something went wrong", error);
});

onSuccess((posts) => {
  console.log("Posts", posts);
});

onMounted(() => {
  fetchPosts();
});
```

## **Features**

- Simple and intuitive interface for making API calls
- Automatically handles errors and provides detailed information about any failures
- Comprehensive state management system
- Allows you to define your API calls using an easy-to-use OpenAI declaration file

## **Note**
